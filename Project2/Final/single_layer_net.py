        Tips:

        - Remember the adjust-by-the-max trick (for each input samp) to prevent numeric overflow!
        This will make the max net_in value for a given input 0.
        - np.sum and np.max have a keepdims optional parameter that might be useful for avoiding
        going from shape=(X, Y) -> (X,). keepdims ensures the result has shape (X, 1).

        coding the correct classes only.

          output neurons.
